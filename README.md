# Introduction

Literally, this is a 2048 game.

This is my first time writing a writing game, so the code might be a bit messy...

# Use

Since my system is Linux, I don't provide binary executables.

## Installation

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/hsn8086/2048.git
cd 2048
pip -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

``` bash
python main.py
```

## Maintainer

_What? It's just a little toy. What do you need a maintainer for?_
